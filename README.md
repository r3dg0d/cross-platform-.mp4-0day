# cross-platform-.mp4-0day
A basic cross-platform .mp4 filebinded 0day exploit, using .mp4 > .exe + fileglued + crypted to Bypass AV.

### Includes File binder for Windows as well as default windows media player icon for dummies

Windows exploit has been tested and works, the next step is developing RCE for Android MediaView RCE, iOS & macOS Quicktime RCE, and other sexy 0-days.
This is high-level advanced hacking btw. Not all RCE exploits guarantee 100% execution rates either. 

### I will add src code later, busy coding sonyplus rn.
